About me
--------

My name is Andy Cuthbert, I'm a Pipeline TD in the VFX/Archvis industry.

Most of my code lives in private repo's but this section of the site contains personal pet projects.

Feel free to ask questions, create pull requests, and generally comment on my code.

I hope to include some other tools soon!
